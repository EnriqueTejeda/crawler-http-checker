# Crawler Http Checker

Simple crawler for check the http code for all urls of your site, all made in Go inside a distroless container (only 11MB~)!

Visit also [docker hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/etejeda/crawler-http-checker).

## How works?

Basically is a simple app that parse your sitemap.xml and then make a request for each url in your site, is very usable for CI integration (for example test each url and terminate if detect any url with a bad http code).

Also you can configure the size of the workers pool for increase the number of parallel task and process all urls more quickly (default value is `1`)!.

## Requirements

* Docker Engine. :heart:

## Getting Started

### Docker :heart:

You only run this command in your terminal:

```
docker run \
-e 'HOST=https://www.enriquetejeda.com' \
etejeda/crawler-http-checker:latest
```

### Standalone

1. Rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the values
2. Compile with the command `make build`
3. Run the command `make run`

### Continuous Integration
#### Jenkins
```
#!groovy
pipeline {
    agent { node { label 'master' } }
    options { skipDefaultCheckout true }
    environment {}
    stages {
        stage('Build'){
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }
        stage('Test'){
            steps {
                echo 'Verify all urls..'
                docker.image('etejeda/crawler-http-checker:latest').run('-e HOST=https://www.enriquetejeda.com')
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy'){
            steps {
                echo 'deploy'
            }
        }
    }   
}
```
